## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Working on this project exposed me to the basic idea of keyboard accessibility when traversing webpages. There is a lot more to learn about building accessible webpages, and I've barely scratched the surface, so this is something I hope to learn more about through future projects. 

### Useful resources

- [This Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73852258/variable-weight-version-of-a-ttf-font-not-working-in-browser) - This helped me use a variable font file for this project for the first time (as opposed to the static files).
- [Smashing Magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/11/guide-keyboard-accessibility-html-css-part1/) - This is an amazing article that dives in to the topic of keyboard accessibility using HTML/CSS. I haven't read the whole thing yet, but I'd love to come back and use this as a resource for future projects involving accessibility.
